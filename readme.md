# Revolutionizing Task Scheduling in ColdBox
Demo code from my Into The Box 2024 session.

## Local Development
Install [CommandBox](http://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox) and browse to the project directory and type:

```bash
box install
```

This will setup all the needed dependencies for the application. You can then type:

```bash
box server start
```

And run the application.
